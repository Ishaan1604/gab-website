- qtn: Are you signed up to Access-A-Ball?
  ans: |
    Yes! Girton Spring Ball 2024 has signed up to the brilliant scheme launched by the Cambridge SU, DSC. The scheme has three main aims:  
    * Reduce the number of students who are excluded from May Week (or similar) events due to access requirements 
    * Increasing the transparency of May Balls, June Events and Garden Parties (and similar)
    * Embedding access considerations and protocols into the mind-sets of committee members, so that they can better provide accessible events in the future.

- qtn: What is the Access-a-Ball pledge?
  ans: "Please find the pledge bellow, but please note that whilst Girton Spring Ball 2024 is not a May Week Event, we will still be following the pledge as other Balls do:
  <br>
  <br>
  “As President of my College’s May Week Event (Girton Spring Ball 2024), I pledge to integrate improving accessibility into all parts of the planning experience such that as many people are able to enjoy the event as possible. 
I pledge to provide for the access needs that we can anticipate, as guided by the Access-a-ball workbook. When an unanticipated access need or a specific request is raised, we will do everything we can to accommodate and make that person feel welcome, getting advice from DSC if unsure how to proceed. 
We will allocate a role on the committee that is fully or partially dedicated to the Accessibility of the Event, and the individual fulfilling this role will attend the ‘Introduction to Event Accessibility’ meeting and ‘Access Statement Training’ held by ‘Access-a-Ball’. ”"
