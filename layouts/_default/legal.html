  <h4 class="fw-bold mb-0 py-4">Introduction</h4>
  <p>
    This statement explains how the Girton College Spring Ball 2025 Committee
    ("GSB 2025", "GSB", "we", "our" or "us") collects and handles personal data
    about you as a user of our ticketing platform and our reasons for doing so.
  </p>
  <p>
    The latest version of this statement can be found on our website at&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.ticketing.girtonspringball.com/privacy"
      >ticketing.girtonspringball.com/privacy</a
    >
    . The GSB 2025 committee is the data controller for data held under this
    privacy statement. The GSB 2025 IT &amp; Ticketing Officers are the
    designated data protection contact, and are in charge of data protection
    matters. They can be contacted at it@girtonspringball.com
  </p>
  <h4 class="fw-bold mb-0 py-4">Definitions</h4>
  <p>
    "Personal data" or "personal information" means information relating to you
    that can be used in some way to identify you, either on its own or in
    combination with other such information available to its holder.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Processing" of personal data is any action taken on that data, such as
    storage, retrieval, organisation, transmission or erasure, and/or as defined
    by relevant legislation.
  </p>
  <p>"University" means the University of Cambridge.</p>
  <p>
    A "CRSid" is a unique identifier issued to a person by the University.
    According to the University, CRSids are never reissued, so we assume that a
    CRSid will uniquely identify the same person forever. Usernames on our
    computer systems are also assigned to match a person&rsquo;s CRSid.
  </p>
  <h4 class="fw-bold mb-0 py-4">The bases on which we process personal data</h4>
  <p>
    The GSB 2025 committee usually processes attendees&rsquo; personal data on
    the basis that it is a legitimate interest of the platform and the Ball.
    Where we process your personal information for a purpose falling outside
    those listed in this statement or our other privacy statements (if
    applicable to you), we will seek your explicit consent before doing so.
  </p>
  <h4 class="fw-bold mb-0 py-4">How attendees&rsquo; personal data is used by the GSB 2025 committee</h4>
  <p>
    The GSB 2025 committee collects and processes members&rsquo; personal data
    for a number of purposes, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Maintaining accurate ticket records (comprising full name, CRSid,
      registered contact email address, join date, last login date, ticket
      details, responses to custom ticket questions);
    </li>
    <li>
      Keeping records of communications made to or from the GSB 2025 executive,
      the IT &amp; Ticketing officers and any members of its committee;
    </li>
    <li>
      Maintaining historical records to enable us to research and analyse our
      own activities over time;
    </li>
    <li>Keeping logs relating to security incidents.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All of the above activities are carried out as a legitimate interest of the
    Ball.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please get in touch with the designated data protection contact if you have
    concerns or queries about any of these stated purposes.
  </p>
  <h4 class="fw-bold mb-0 py-4">How we obtain and share your personal data</h4>
  <p>
    We primarily obtain your personal data through you providing it to us, for
    example when you sign up to the platform to purchase a ticket. However, this
    initial signup process also involves automatic retrieval of information
    available to any computer on the University network. Our systems look up
    this information using your CRSid, which is provided to us by the
    University&apos;s Raven service, which itself is used to authenticate to our
    platform. When signing up, you will have a chance to correct and amend any
    or all of this automatically-obtained information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your personal data is not usually shared outside the GSB 2025 committee and
    its members. However, the GSB 2025 committee may otherwise be required to
    share (with or without your consent) your personal data with the University,
    or become subject to a legal requirement to share it with a third party.
    Where possible in either situation, we will notify you in advance of our
    intention to do so, but this may sometimes be prohibited, for example by law
    or an injunction.

    Your information is securely stored in a datacenter managed by our hosting
    provider. Additionally, all transactions involving the sharing of your
    personal data are carried out over secure networks (as far as is technically
    possible on our end). We retain your personal information for 3 months after
    the date of the Ball, which is March 21st 2025. After this, the only data we
    hold about you will be anonymized and turned into numerical data for future
    statistical analysis. Any identifiable information will be disposed of.
